I enjoy it.

A long time ago, when I was a kid, in my summer break, I had a maths tutor. He gave me some homework. I remember it how. Solve the equation: `PLUS + PLUS + PLUS + PLUS = MATHE`.

Every letter represented a unique digit. I had to find all combinations that match it.

I went home, and started grinding. Spent about 4 hours and came up with nothing. I was ashamed. Next day, went to my tutor and said I had failed.

He nodded, and said, no problem. This is not a math problem. This is a programming problem.

Then he showed me the solution. A BASIC program, employing the Backtracking algorithm, which would solve the problem.

I was mesmerised. I did not understand anything, of course. Then, he ran it. And, over the course of a few minutes, the program ran on a Z80 processor, and printed out a solution every few seconds.

Thatâ€™s when I knew that I wanted to be a programmer.
