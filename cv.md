## Work experience
{: .text-2xl .font-semibold .text-gray-700 .mb-4 .border-b-2 .border-blue-500 .pb-2}

`May 2023 - May 2025`
**Builder.ai**, Principal Engineer (IC5)

Led technical transformation across 4 engineering teams focused on Application Assembly and Building Blocks platform serving hundreds of SME customers.

Strategic Architecture & Standards:

* Designed new platform architecture supporting stack-agnostic backends (`Python/Django/FastAPI`, `Node.js/Next.js`) with `React & React Native` frontends, moving away from single stack support, while reducing the complexity of stack upgrades by proper employment of separation of concerns.
* Defined versioning and maintenance policies for 500+ software components, enabling adoption of `SemVer`, and ensuring compatibility between components.
* Established error handling and testing standards, improving components reliability and security.
* Participated in Architecture Review Board, defining an Architectural Framework (inspired by `TOGAF`) for the BX Org Unit: Architecture Repository, templates for Baseline Architecture, Solution Designs, defined Governance process.

Developer Productivity & Innovation:

* Built Blocksmith GenAI framework for batch maintenance of Blocks, reducing manual work by 90%: automatic documentation generation, application of error handling and unit testing standards, stack upgrades. Learned `Python` from scratch in the process, using GenAI dev tools (`Github Copilot`, `Cline / Memory Bank`).
* Designed and implemented Blocks Workspace, enabling turn-key local full-stack development, cutting developer onboarding time from days to minutes. `Python`, `Node.js`, `[mise](http://mise.jdx.dev/)`, `uv`.
* Implemented BVM (Blocks Version Manager) filling gaps in platform package managers, improving dependency resolution of Blocks. This allowed the rollout of SemVer for Blocks, taking into account their compatibility with the stack version as well (Ruby, Node.js, React, React Native).

Infrastructure & Tooling:

* Architected highly modular CI/CD pipelines for 500+ components using [`gitlab-ci-local`](https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local) to enable rapid feedback loop and unit tests for pipelines themselves. `Python`, `Node.js`, `Ruby`.
* Built Neo4j-based dependency graph improving stack upgrade process efficiency and allowing Natasha AI to understand the dependencies between components using `MCP`.
* Drove adoption of GenAI development tools across teams, modernising and improving developers' workflows. `Github Copilot`, `Roo Code`, `Cursor`.
